## About Me

Independent Blockchain Engineer and AI Systems Architect based in Latin America. I design and build smart contracts, DeFi protocols, and AI-powered agent platforms across multiple chains. My work spans from low-level Rust programs on Solana to full-stack dApps on EVM chains, Move-based networks, and Stacks.

---

## What I'm Building

**AI Agent Platforms** -- Designing agent architectures with persistent memory systems, blockchain-based identity, and autonomous on-chain execution. Focused on making agents smarter with smaller models, optimizing costs through RAG, ReRAG, and multivector search pipelines.

**DeFi Protocols** -- Building lending protocols, liquidation engines, vault architecture, and flash loan integrations for decentralized markets.

**Uniswap V4 Hooks & AMM Design** -- Building custom hooks for Uniswap V4 pools, including KOL-gated liquidity strategies. Graduate of the Uniswap Hook Incubator (Cohort 5, Atrium Academy).

**Prediction Markets & On-Chain Derivatives** -- Developing prediction market contracts and derivative instruments on Bitcoin L2s.

**Cross-Chain Mobile Wallets** -- Engineering mobile wallet experiences on Move-based chains (Aptos) with seamless cross-chain asset management.

**Stablecoin Infrastructure** -- Creating fiat-backed stablecoin systems with minting/burning mechanics, compliance tooling, and token bridge infrastructure.

**DeFi Education in Cadence** -- Running independent sessions teaching DeFi development on Flow using Cadence, with comparative analysis against EVM (Solidity) and Solana architectures.

## Research Interests

### AI Agent Architecture

I care about making agents genuinely smarter, not just throwing bigger models at the problem. Areas I'm actively working on:

- **Cost-efficient inference** -- Getting strong results from small models through careful prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and routing. Not every task needs GPT-4.
- **RAG & ReRAG pipelines** -- Retrieval-augmented generation with re-ranking and iterative retrieval loops for agents that actually find the right context.
- **Multivector search** -- Dense + sparse hybrid retrieval for agent memory systems. ColBERT-style late interaction models for precision when it matters.
- **Persistent memory architectures** -- Long-term memory systems for agents that learn, forget gracefully, and build real context over time.

### Applied Mathematics in DeFi

Math is at the core of how I design protocols. In my prediction markets work I implemented:

- **Gaussian AMM (pm-AMM)** -- Pricing via the standard normal CDF/PDF (Abramowitz-Stegun approximation), achieving uniform Loss-Versus-Rebalancing across all price levels.
- **LMSR (Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule)** -- Hanson's cost function `C(q) = b * ln(sum(e^(q_i/b)))` for multi-outcome markets with bounded market maker loss.
- **Fixed-point numerical methods** -- Taylor series for `e^x`, binary search for swap outputs preserving AMM invariants, Newton's method for integer square roots. All at 8-decimal precision in Clarity.
- **Game-theoretic mechanisms** -- Exponential bond escalation for dispute resolution, quadratic voting with reputation decay, and vote-escrow (veCRV-style) governance.
- **Dynamic liquidity & fee models** -- Time-dependent liquidity `L(t) = L0 * sqrt((T-t)/T)` and exponential fee curves to protect LPs from informed traders near resolution.

### Software Architecture

- **Clean code over vibe coding** -- I care about readable, maintainable code. Clear abstractions, minimal complexity, no unnecessary cleverness.
- **Protocol design** -- Layered contract architectures with separation of concerns. Math libraries, core logic, and integration layers as distinct modules.

### Ethereum Standards

I actively follow and experiment with new ERC/EIP proposals:

- **EIP-7702** -- EOA account code delegation (Pectra). Every EOA becomes a smart account: batching, gas sponsorship, session keys without wallet migration.
- **ERC-7579** -- Modular smart accounts. Vendor-neutral plugin system (validators, executors, hooks). Adopted by Safe, Biconomy, ZeroDev. The ERC-20 of account abstraction.
- **ERC-6551** -- Token Bound Accounts. NFTs with their own wallets. Transfer the NFT, transfer everything it owns.
- **ERC-4626** -- Tokenized Vaults. The backbone of composable DeFi yield. Essential for lending, yield, and RWA protocols.
- **ERC-404** -- Semi-fungible tokens. ERC-20/721 hybrid that solves NFT liquidity natively. Interesting design pattern.
- **EIP-7691 & EIP-7594** -- Blob scaling (Pectra + Fusaka). Doubled blob capacity + PeerDAS. Reshaping L2 economics and data availability costs.
